see dependencies.txt for that...

starting zookeeper:
./zk.sh <unique_str>
example:
./zk.sh zk_run_5

server usage:
python server.py –host <hostip> –port <xxxx> -zookeeper <zkip> -zookeeper_port
<zkport> 
example:
python3 server.py -host 127.0.0.1 -port 34567 -zookeeper 127.0.0.1 2181
This can also be started by ./start_server.sh <port_num>, assuming the zk docker
is running on default port/ip

client usage:
The servers use a rest api via http. This means a web browser or wget can easily set and retrieve
values from the server with get requests (yes, get, not put/post).
The servers expose 2 endpoints to the client:
/key
/key/value
The first returns the value of the key. The second sets the value.
The endpoints can also easily be used with anything that makes http requests,
sucha s the requests library in python which is how testing is done.

driver-test usage:
./driver_test.sh <unique_zk_name> <port1> <port2> <port3>
This will start the zk docker, then start 3 servers. After this, it will
run the required requests for test1 from a python script. It will then kill
the leader (the first server), then run requests from a python file for test 2.
Lastly, it will bring the old leader node back up and run the required requests.
